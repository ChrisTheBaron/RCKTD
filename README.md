The code here accompanies the video series ['Developing a 2D Arcade Game with Monogame 3.8'](https://diode.zone/videos/watch/playlist/32f7350a-1695-4bde-a389-6554ff628dcd).

You can find the code associated with each video by following the link in the description, or looking at the [branches](https://github.com/ChrisTheBaron/RCKTD/branches).

If you like what you see, you can show your appreciation and support me to make more things.
